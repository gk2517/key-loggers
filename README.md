# key-loggers
Overview
This project is focused on protecting web applications from keyloggers and preventing JavaScript injection attacks. The solution includes mechanisms for securely handling user input and preventing unauthorized access through methods like Base64 encoding.

Features
Keylogger Detection: Implements techniques to detect and mitigate keyloggers that may be capturing user inputs.
JavaScript Injection Prevention: Uses PHP to sanitize and validate user inputs, preventing malicious JavaScript code from being injected into the application.
Base64 Encoding: Sensitive information, such as passwords, is encoded using Base64 to add an additional layer of security.
Session Management: Secure session handling in PHP to ensure that user data is protected during interactions with the web application.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: Client-side scripting to enhance security and user interaction.
PHP: Server-side scripting for handling input validation, session management, and database interactions.
CSS: Styling of web pages for a user-friendly interface.
Base64: Encoding mechanism used to secure sensitive data.

Usage
